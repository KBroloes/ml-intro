# A Brief Introduction to Machine Learning (with Keras)

To run this project, either use a locally installed jupyter with tensorflow, keras and pygraphviz, or simply run `docker-compose up` in this directory and use the provided docker image. It will have everything you need.

If you're new to Jupyter notebooks, running this command will create a running notebook server on your machine, exposed at port 8888.
After running this command, you can go to http://127.0.0.1:8888 to see your server.
You'll notice it will require a token for you to access it - you can find that token in the output logs of the `docker-compose` command. It will look something like this:

	http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=ecf605284aee8faf1e7edd6b647a7ba5d2bc3b539938e07e

You can in some terminals also just click the link to open it and automatically log in.

## Exercises

The exercises are labelled with numbers and I recommend starting with the first.

## Tips

If you're new to how jupyter notebooks work, I recommend the interactive tutorial at: https://jupyter.org/try (pick the classic one). It is a bit lengthy, and covers most features. We'll only need a subset, so you can also just experiment here.

Have fun!
